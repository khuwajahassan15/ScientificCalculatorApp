A useful for situations where we need to calculate some complex things like logs or trigonometry





This calculator will have the following

    First, it will have a screen to display the user inputs and by default, it will display a “0”. To make this we will use Text View.
    Then there will be another screen that shows the result and the operator. It will be a TextView too.
    Then we’ll have the keys, that will have numbers as well as the operators on it. We’ll use Buttons for this.
    We’ll use a Linear layout for this so that we can arrange the buttons in the desired manner.
